# alpha-shop-vue2

This is an eCommerce checkout page implemented base on [UI designed by AlphaCamp](https://www.figma.com/file/8D1kUmCDV02GGGroemX8SF/ACCapstone%3A-Frontend-UI?node-id=3%3A5 'figma') using Vue.js framework. This webpage provides popular user experience features including RWD, SPA, dark mode, multi-step form, quick validation check and confirmation modals.

In the past, I have built a same webpage using DOM [here](https://codepen.io/JennesyDai/pen/abEyWNN) (without validation check feature). Comparing the Vue version and the past DOM version, with the help of Vue.js framework, not only the building process is much easier and faster, the resulting code also gets to become more structured, clean and maintainable.
